OS X NOTES
**************************

1) Install GDCM (tested with 2.4)

$ git clone --branch release git://git.code.sf.net/p/gdcm/gdcm
$ mkdir gdcmbin
$ cd gdcmbin
$ cmake ../gdcm
$ make -j
$ sudo make install

You can remove the gdcm and gdcmbin directories now.

2) Install GLFW (tested with 3.0.3)

$ git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
$ cd glfw
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
$ sudo make install



WINDOWS NOTES
**************************

MSVC will complain if mixing release mode libraries with debug mode Medleap. Build both configurations, but make sure the debug libraries have _d postfix added to them.

GLFW needs the MSVC runtime dlls to execute, so distribute that with the executable. There is a CMAKE options to turn it off as well, maybe use this?

Install GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/).
- Download GLFW 3.0.4 archive and extract it (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\glfw-3.0.4)
- Run CMake GUI
	- Set source code path (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\glfw-3.0.4)
	- Set build binaries path to to its own directory (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\glfw-3.0.4_build)
	- Configure using VS12 (if using VS 2013)
	- Make sure "Advanced" option is checked in GUI
	- Add Entry: Name=CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX, Type=String, Value="_d"
	- Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to desired path (ex. C:\Users\justin\libs\GLFW)
	- Configure again to update variables, then Generate
- Open GLFW.sln in the build directory
	- Run ALL_BUILD target followed by INSTALL target (do this for both Debug and Release configs if needed)
- Add a new environment variable GLFW_DIR pointing to path used for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

Install GDCM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/).
- Download GDCM 2.4.0 archive and extract it (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\gdcm-2.4.0)
- Run CMake GUI
	- Set source code path (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\gdcm-2.4.0)
	- Set build binaries path to its own directory (ex. C:\Users\justin\Projects\gdcm-2.4.0_build)
	- Configure using VS12 (if using VS 2013)
	- Make sure "Advanced" option is checked in GUI
	- Change GDCM_DEBUG_POSTFIX to _d 
	- Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to desired path (ex. C:\Users\Justin\libs\GDCM)
	- Configure again to update variables, then Generate
- Open GDCM.sln
	- Run ALL_BUILD target followed by INSTALL target (do this for both Debug and Release configs if needed)
- Add a new environment variable GDCM_DIR pointing to path used for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
